This is my simple app for counting EVs when training Pokemon in 3rd gen main series games.
I made it just for myself and I didn't include any features I didn't need so it might not be very useful for anyone except me, but I decided to share it anyway because why not.

If you want to use it just clone this repo (or download ev_counter.html) and open ev_counter.html in your web browser. I only tested it on Google Chrome on desktop (Windows) so I can't guarantee that it will work on anything else.
